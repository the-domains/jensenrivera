# Valentine's Caterpillar

Eva and I are making a Heart shaped caterpillar for Valentine's Day.  The intent is to be able to hang this on the her door, but really it's wherever she decides she wants to hang it!

## Step 1:

I created the heart and butterfly templates for Eva and then I had her start cutting them all out herself.  She's really good at cutting around the edges.

All cut out!

## Step 2:

The body is complete. We laid down the hearts in the shape we wanted and used a wooden dowel to attach them to.

A bit of silly time!

## Step 3:

We attached Pom-poms as buttons for the caterpillar.

## Step 4:

We used pipe cleaners for the ears and hung the butterflies from some twine. We added some heart stickers onto the butterflies for fun!

# Valentine's Caterpillar

Eva and I are making a Heart shaped caterpillar for Valentine's Day.  The intent is to be able to hang this on the her door, but really it's wherever she decides she wants to hang it!

I created the heart and butterfly templates for Eva and then I had her start cutting them all out herself.  She's really good at cutting around the edges.

The body is complete. We laid down the hearts in the shape we wanted and used a wooden dowel to attach them to.

A bit of silly time!

We attached Pom-poms as buttons for the caterpillar.

Here is the final product before we hung it up. We used pipe cleaners for the ears and hung the butterflies from some twine.

Eva decided to hang it on the wall!
